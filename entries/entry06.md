***TAKEAWAYS:***
<br>
Looking back at the process and outcome of the project, I have learned a lot along the way. For future projects, I would definitely spend more time considering features in making projects more creative. 
_____
***EXPO:***
<br>
In preparation for the EXPO, my partner and I created an [Elevator Pitch Script](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_DHxrUDv8ICCdYxp491jYea84f_752Jh8T3okQAJTr4/edit#heading=h.6o1f62qg6jz9). An Elevator Pitch is a short description of an idea/project. At first, I was worried about how I would present my project at the EXPO, but the worries lowered as more people came to learn about my project. Scores from the judges are presented below:

Creativity: 2.5
<br>
Usability: 3.5
<br>
Enjoyability(09)/Practicality(10/11/12): 3.5
<br>
Presentation: 3.5

As an individual, I have always struggled with being creative, so creativity is definitely something I have to work on. The functionality of this project works as prompted, however, there aren't any interactive features for users to engage with the web application. I also learned that providing an Elevator Pitch and including internal preparation, it has allowed me to be more confident with presenting my project. 
_____
***IN-CLASS PRESENTATION:***
<br>
For the in-class presentation, it was more formal where, [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Ts-R3d-wly-ERXzzUwvy3dt_8hbUBbGSlEaOZzce7XQ/edit#slide=id.g12c69b5a339_0_0) have to be make in illistrating the journey that was taken in order to acheive the project. Scores for my presentation are presented below:

Hook: 2/2
<br>
Coherence: 2/2
<br>
Presence: 1/2
<br>
Visuals: 2/2
<br>
Conclusion: 2/2
<br>
Presentation Grade: 9/10

From the feedback, I learned that making eye-contacts with the audience is key. I should also double-check each slide to assure that the audience would be able to see each slide that I am presenting. I am really proud of myself for continuing the presentation even though I made a mistake. 
_____
***ENGINEERING DESIGN PROCESS:***
<br>
I am at the last stage of the Engineering Design Process which is **Communicating The Results**. I am proud of what my partner and I have made. I am also grateful for being a part of HSTAT community to experience such achievement.
_____
***SKILLS:***
<br>
The skills that I have used are **Organization** and **Communication**. Since I have a partner for this project, **Communication** is key when we are trying to get our ideas across. Thus, we practiced presenting our project via ZOOM to see if there should be any adjustments that needed to be made. In addition to presenting our project, we had to organize an easy-to-follow process map where the audience would understand what we are presenting.
