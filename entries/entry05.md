***CONTEXT:***
<br>
Throughout the past weeks, I have been finishing my MVP by importing all the key notes and ideas for the APCSA course. As we decided to use CS50 as our tool, we are mainly focusing on Python and Flask.

_____
***ENGINEERING DESIGN PROCESS:***
<br>
Throughout the Engineering Design Process, I am currently in **Test and evaluate the prototype**. 

_____
***SKILLS:***
<br>
The skills I used are **Consideration** and **Embracing failure**. As this webpage is ment to benefit others in knowing and understanding the concepts of APCSA, we took consideration in how we would like to layout the information which presented as the order of how we would input informations. Embracing failures is another skill I've used because learning a tool may seen easy, but reflecting what I have learned onto a webpage may be annoying and difficult. Thus, embracing from my failures would allow me to grow and understand the key points that I might of missed.

_____
***NEXT STEP:***
<br>
My next steps would be debugging for asure that the webpage runs smoothly without errors. After that, we would be working on the layout and make further adjestments if needed.
