***CONTEXT:***
<br>
For the past week, I've been working with my partner, Sarah, in coming up with a project idea with the use of the tool, [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2021/fall/). We have decided that we are making a web application of a study guide (something like ProjectSTEM) on the AP Computer Science A (APCSA) course. In the CS50 tool, 9 weeks/lessons are presented by lectures. Throughout the 9 weeks, I think it is best to focus on weeks 6 through 9 where David J. Malan, the instructor of the lectures, thoroughly explains Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Flask. I believe that learning these topics would allow me to make a web application where it's a python structured study guide on APCSA. Unlike other study guides, I am planning on having a study guide that covers the key ideas of each unit in APCSA while including a little quiz or practice activity for individuals to work on. Sarah and I were considering making an app application instead of a web application, but with the amount of information we have to learn in Swift/Android along with CS50, it would be excessive for the two of us to handle. Despite that [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2021/fall/) only provides 9 weeks of information, I found a channel on YouTube called [This is CS50.](https://www.youtube.com/c/cs50) that provides lectures from previous years and other short clips of students explaining the concept of CS50.

***ENGINEERING DESIGN PROCESS:***
<br>
Throughout the Engineering Design Process, I have defined and researched the problem which is to create a study guide on APCSA using CS50. Now, I am currently brainstorming on how I would like my application to be as well as planning the most promising solution which starts with learning the actual tool. With an idea of what we want to incorporate in our web application, it is only possible for us to begin building the application once we grasp the key concepts in CS50 and APCSA. As we are currently taking the course APCSA, we would be updating the application as we obtain more knowledge on APCSA.

***SKILLS:***
<br>
The skills I used would be **Communication** and **Problem Decomposition**. The skill Problem Decomposition allowed me to break down the different topics within CS50, making it easier for me to understand since it's being presented by topics. By breaking things down into smaller parts, visually help me see where I am going in understanding the tool. Communication is the other skill I used because when working in a group, my ideas need to get to my partner, vise versa. By sharing ideas, we would have a better idea in coming up with an application that satisfies both of us. Overall, I think **Problem Decomposition** and **Communication** are skills that helped me understand my tool, CS50 while articulating ideas to my partner in how we are going to build our application.
