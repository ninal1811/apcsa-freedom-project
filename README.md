# APCSA Freedom Project
by Nina Li

## Context
The “Freedom Project” for APCSA is all about learning a tool to create a project. It also prompts students to explore the different tools and learn one of the tools in order to make a project of their desires. The purpose of this blog is to keep track of the "journey" in addition to learning the tool and creating the project itself.

## Content
For my project, I am making a Study Guide for APCSA. This blog will walk through my process of independently studying CS50 (Python and Flask) in order to make the study guide containing notes on the APCSA course and records what I have accomplished throughout the process.

## Implications
The purpose of my project is to be informative on the topic in the APCSA course. Unlike other projects that usually contain either global, social, or economic impacts, my project depicts its impact through education. Through an educational view, students who are planning to take the APCSA exam can use this web application which presents a global impact. Moreover, if a fee is required in order to access the notes, there is an economic impact since people are making a profit out of it. 

On the other hand, as the project is a study guide, individuals may think that they can pass the APCSA exam just by studying this study guide. This study guide is meant to be a refresher for topics on the APCSA course. Initially, individuals should be taking their own notes and testing with JAVA in preparation for the exam. Since this is a study guide created based on how I study, it may not work for everyone as everyone's study habits are different.
